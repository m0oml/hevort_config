; ================================================================================
; Bed Compensation Macro (G32) - Triple Z-Screw Tilt Correction
; Iterative 3-point tramming using ALPS probe (K0) and M671 pivot geometry.
; Requires M671 in config.g defining the POS8 bearing / MGN12 rail junctions.
; Probe point layout:
;   P0 - front-right (Z0, driver 0.0)   P1 - rear (Z1, 0.1)   P2 - front-left (Z2, 0.2)
; This order MUST match the M671 coordinate order in config.g - RRF pairs G30 P<n>
; to the n-th M671 entry, so a mismatch silently corrects the WRONG motor. It is
; invisible on a near-level bed (all three corrections come out equal) and only
; shows up as failure to converge once the bed is genuinely out of tram.
; Corner-to-driver mapping confirmed physically 21/08/2026 by M584 single-driver.
; This does NOT run a mesh (G29) - that is a separate step once G32 converges.

; --- 1. Kinematic state validation ---
M561                                                             ; Clear any active bed transform before tramming
if !move.axes[0].homed || !move.axes[1].homed || !move.axes[2].homed

; --- 2. Probe setup ---
; config.g's M558 H5 is tuned for normal operation once the bed is close to
; level. An untrammed bed can be further out than that, so widen the search
; window for tramming and restore it at the end.
; Two-value H (RRF 3.5+): the 20mm dive applies only to the first probe at each
; point - i.e. on arrival after a travel across a potentially untrammed bed.
; The A8 repeat probes at the same XY retract just 2mm, so averaging stays fast.
M558 K0 H20:2                                                    ; Dive: 20mm on arrival, 2mm between repeats (was 40, excessive - 25/08/2026)

; Single clearance move before the first travel. Homing leaves the nozzle at
; trigger height, which is not safe to traverse an untrammed bed at. After each
; G30 completes RRF retracts to dive height automatically, so subsequent
; travels within the loop need no further Z handling.
; M569.7 fires the brake port at the same time as driver enable, but RRF gives
; no automatic delay in this direction - force enable and wait before moving Z.
