; deployprobe.g - ALPS strain-gauge probe enable
; RRF runs this before every probing move. M558 P9 re-arms between every probe
; ATTEMPT, not every probe POINT - with A8 retries a 49-point mesh ran this 171
; times (measured 16/09/2026), so keep it cheap.
;
; The enable is CYCLED, not just asserted. The typical hot-chamber failure is
; "Z probe already triggered at start of probing move": the resting value is at
; or above the G31 threshold before the nozzle has moved anywhere. Dropping the
; enable and re-asserting forces the gauge to re-zero. On a healthy point this
; costs one object-model read and nothing else - the 1s retry only runs when the
; baseline is actually bad, so it does not lengthen a normal mesh.
;
; Compared against sensors.probes[0].threshold, not a hardcoded 500, so it
; follows G31 P automatically.
