; Bed Mesh Macro - Grid Levelling (G29 S0)
; Probes a grid over the bed with the ALPS strain-gauge probe (K0) and saves the
; result to 0:/sys/heightmap.csv. printstart.g loads it with G29 S1.
;
; This is the step AFTER G32 (bed.g). G32 corrects the bed PLANE via the three Z
; motors; this corrects what is left - slab, FR4 and PEI surface irregularity.
; Running a mesh over an untrammed bed just bakes the tilt into the map, so this
; macro RUNS G32 itself and verifies it converged before probing any grid.
;
; PREREQUISITES - mesh values are meaningless until these are real:
;   - G31 Z trigger height is SET and derived: Z-0.134, config.g line 77.
;   - M558 probe mode is RESOLVED: P9, config.g line 76.
;   - The FINAL granite slab is fitted (09/09/2026) with the mat bonded to it,
;     so maps taken on it are the real baseline, not provisional.

; --- 3. Grid definition ---
; Probe offsets are X0 Y0 (nozzle-coincident strain gauge), so the grid can use
; the full reachable envelope less a small edge margin. M208 is X0:400 Y0:400
; Z-10:370 (Y raised from 390 and Z from 300, tested 29/08/2026). The Y16 floor
; is kept because it is a REACH limit already proven in bed.g, not a preference;
; the top is set so the grid centres on the bed centre, X200 Y200.
; P7:7 = 49 points, ~63mm X / ~61mm Y spacing. That suits a rigid granite slab.
; With M558 A8 averaging each point costs several seconds - raise to P9:9 or
; P11:11 only if the saved map shows real structure between existing points.
