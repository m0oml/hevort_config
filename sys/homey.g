; Home Y Axis - Dual-pass coarse/fine homing
; Y homes to min (front) - Omron EE-SX67x on io5.in
; Drops all four AWD drivers to open loop for homing, restores closed loop after
; (per Duet 1HCL documentation). All four are switched because on CoreXY a Y move
; drives both belts, so every motor participates.
