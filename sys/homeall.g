; Home All Axes - Sequential Y, X, then Z
; AWD CoreXY with physical endstops, Z via probe at bed centre
; Y and X both home to min (front / left). Y FIRST (17/09/2026, Trev).
; Axes homed one at a time - on CoreXY a combined move keeps both motors driving
; after the first endstop triggers
; Drops all four AWD drivers to open loop for homing, restores closed loop before
; the Z probe (per Duet 1HCL documentation)

; no automatic delay in this direction (S param on M569.7 only covers the
; engage-on-disable side). Force enable and wait before the first Z move.
